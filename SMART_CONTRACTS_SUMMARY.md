const marketplace = ArtisticSplashMarketplace__factory.connect(marketplaceAddress, signer);
```

### Example: Mint and List

```typescript
// 1. Mint NFT
const mintTx = await nft.safeMint(
  userAddress,
  "ipfs://QmYourMetadataHash"
);
await mintTx.wait();

// 2. Approve marketplace
const approveTx = await nft.approve(marketplaceAddress, tokenId);
await approveTx.wait();

// 3. List for sale
const listTx = await marketplace.listItem(
  nftAddress,
  tokenId,
  ethers.parseEther("1.0")
);
await listTx.wait();
```

## 📊 Contract Addresses (After Deployment)

After running deployment, you'll get:

```json
{
  "network": "fuji",
  "chainId": 43113,
  "contracts": {
    "ArtisticSplashNFT": {
      "address": "0x...",
      "deployer": "0x..."
    },
    "ArtisticSplashMarketplace": {
      "address": "0x...",
      "deployer": "0x..."
    }
  }
}
```

Save these addresses for frontend integration!

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Before Mainnet Deployment

- [ ] Run Slither static analysis: `slither contracts/`
- [ ] Get professional smart contract audit
- [ ] Test on Fuji with real scenarios for 2-4 weeks
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Prepare incident response plan
- [ ] Consider bug bounty program
- [ ] Set up multisig for admin functions
- [ ] Implement timelock for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add circuit breaker/pause functionality (if needed)
- [ ] Insurance for smart contract risks

### Operational Security

- ✅ Environment variables in .env (never commit)
- ✅ Private key validation in hardhat config
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Emergency rescue function (owner only)
- ⚠️ Keep admin private keys in hardware wallet
- ⚠️ Use multisig for production admin functions
- ⚠️ Monitor contract activity continuously

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why use OpenZeppelin?**
A: Industry-standard, audited, battle-tested contracts. Saves development time and reduces security risks.

**Q: Why pull payment pattern instead of direct transfers?**
A: Prevents reentrancy attacks and provides better separation of concerns. Recipients withdraw when ready.

**Q: Can the platform fee be changed after deployment?**
A: Yes, but only by the contract owner, and it's capped at 10% to prevent abuse.

**Q: What happens to royalties if the NFT doesn't support ERC-2981?**
A: The marketplace gracefully handles this and skips royalty payment, sending full amount (minus platform fee) to seller.

**Q: Can sellers cancel their listings?**
A: Yes, sellers can cancel anytime and get their NFT back immediately.

**Q: What if someone sends an NFT directly to the marketplace?**
A: The owner can rescue non-listed tokens using the `rescueToken` function.

**Q: Is this ready for mainnet?**
A: The code follows best practices, but get a professional audit before mainnet deployment with real funds.
