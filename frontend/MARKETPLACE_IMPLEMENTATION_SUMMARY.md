## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Unable to get transaction hash"
**Cause**: NFT from different contract than configured in `.env.local`

**Solution**: 
- Mint fresh NFT with current contract
- Or update `.env.local` to match NFT's contract
- Warning system now alerts users before attempting

### Issue: Transactions taking 2 steps
**Status**: This is EXPECTED behavior, not a bug

**Reason**: 
1. Security: Marketplace needs explicit approval
2. Standard ERC-721 pattern
